# Oxygen Sensitivity Infection and Cancer
 
This portfolio project explores the relationship of cancer induced hypoxia and microbial/microbiome growth in gastric cancer. The aim is to understand how infection or presence of microbes in an hypoxic cancer environemnt impact cancer growth, theraperutic interventions and the overall outcome of disease.

##Goals

- Identify cancer datasets that can be used in the analysis.
- Analyse patterns of gene expression that are hypoxia related and infection related.
- Study relationship between hyoxia, cancer and microbial growth
- See how therapeutic intervention changes these patterns
- Derive biological insights

##Data Sources
- TCGA dataset for cancer
- GEO dataset for H. pylori
- Microbiome data from SRA/metgenomics

##Tools
- Jupyter Notebook (Python/R)
- Bioinformatics libraries
- Github for version control
